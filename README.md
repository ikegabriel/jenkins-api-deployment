# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation for Simple API Deployment

---

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy a simple API using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS (Amazon Web Services).

### Scope
The scope of this documentation covers the entire CI/CD pipeline setup, from configuring Jenkins to deploying the API on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).

---

## 2. Prerequisites

### Tools and Services
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following tools and services in place:
- Jenkins CI Server
- Docker
- DockerHub
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Terraform
- SonarQube

### Access Permissions
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create resources in Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. You'll need:
- Admin access to Jenkins.
- AWS IAM user with permissions for ECR and ECS.

---

## 3. Setting up Jenkins

### Jenkins Installation
1. Install Jenkins by following the official installation instructions for your operating system.

### Jenkins Configuration
2. Configure Jenkins with the required plugins:
   - Install the Docker plugin to enable Docker integration.
   - Install any necessary source code management (SCM) plugins (e.g., Git).
   - Install the sonar-scanner plugin

3. Set up the necessary credentials in Jenkins:
   - Configure your SCM credentials (e.g., GitHub credentials).
   - Configure Docker Hub or AWS credentials for image pushing/pulling.
   - Configure your SonarQube token
   - Configure other secrets and credentials as needed (e.g., SECRET_KEY)

---

## 4. Creating the CI/CD Pipeline

### Jenkins Job Configuration
4. Create a new Jenkins job for your CI/CD pipeline:
   - Choose the "Pipeline" type job.
   - Configure the job to pull the source code from your SCM repository (e.g., GitHub).
   - Define the build and deployment stages in the Jenkinsfile (see section 8).

---

## 5. Dockerizing the API

### Dockerfile
5. Create a Dockerfile for your API:
   - Include all necessary dependencies.
   - Expose the required ports.
   - Define the entry point for running the API.

### Building the Docker Image
6. Build and tag the Docker image:
   - Use `docker build` to create the image.
   - Use `docker tag` to give it a name with the repository URL and version tag.
   - Use `docker push` to push the image to Docker Hub or an Amazon ECR repository (see section 6).

---

## 6. Setting up AWS

### AWS Account
7. Sign in to your AWS account or create one if you haven't already.

### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Optional)
8. Create an ECR repository to store your Docker images:
   - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create the repository.
   - Note down the repository URI.

### AWS IAM Role
9. Create an AWS IAM role with the necessary permissions for ECS:
   - Attach policies like `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` and `AmazonECS_FullAccess` to the role.
   - Attach this role to your ECS task definition (see section 7).

### CONFIGURE APP ENVIRONMENT
10. Configure the environment of the AWS service whiich you wish to deploy the app to. For this instance its AWS Fargate:


---

## 7. Deploying to AWS ECS

### ECS Cluster Configuration
10. Set up an ECS cluster:
    - Create a cluster in the AWS Management Console.
    - Configure the cluster with the desired EC2 instances or Fargate tasks.

### ECS Task Definition
11. Create an ECS task definition:
    - Define the container using the Docker image from your Container repository e.g DockerHub.
    - Configure networking, resource limits, and environment variables.

### ECS Service
12. Configure an ECS service:
    - Specify the task definition created in the previous step.
    - Define the desired number of tasks and scaling options.

---

## 8. Configuring the CI/CD Pipeline

### Jenkinsfile
13. Create a Jenkinsfile in your source code repository:
    - Define stages for building and pushing the Docker image.
    - Define a deployment stage to update the ECS service with the new task definition.

### Webhook Configuration
14. Set up webhooks or triggers in your SCM repository to automatically trigger the Jenkins job on code commits.

---

## 9. Testing and Monitoring

### Automated Testing
15. Implement automated tests within your CI/CD pipeline:
    - Use testing frameworks suitable for your API (e.g., Postman, JUnit).
    - Run tests as a part of the Jenkins pipeline.

### Monitoring and Logging
16. Configure monitoring and logging for your AWS ECS deployment:
    - Utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.
    - Set up log streams and groups for container logs.

---

## 10. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance
17. Regularly update your pipeline as your codebase evolves:
    - Update the Docker image version and task definition.
    - Ensure the Jenkinsfile reflects any changes in the build and deployment process.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
18. Troubleshoot any issues that may arise during CI/CD pipeline execution or AWS ECS deployment:
    - Check Jenkins build logs.
    - Review AWS CloudWatch logs.
    - Monitor AWS ECS events.

## 11. Conclusion

This documentation has provided a comprehensive guide to setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS for deploying a simple API. Following these steps will enable you to automate the build and deployment processes, making it easier to deliver your API to production.
